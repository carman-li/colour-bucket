# Colour Bucket ðŸŽ¨

A web app where users can upload an image and generate a colour palette for it. Once an image has been uploaded, users have the option to search through their uploads by hexcode. 

The app is hosted [here!](https://photo-dump-787f3.web.app/home) Feel free to play around :)

## How to use the app:
#### Return to homepage
To return to the homepage at any time, click "Colour Bucket" at the top of the page. Note that if you refresh the page, all your uploaded files will be lost. 

#### Upload an image
From the homescreen, click the "upload image" button. You will be taken to the upload page, where you can click "choose images" to select an image. Once you have selected an image, the file name and image preview wil show. To upload, click "upload".

#### Search through images
Once you have uploaded at least one image, you can search by hexcode. If you want to copy the hexcode of a colour chip to your keyboard, simply click on it. Once you have entered a search term, hit the search button. To remove clear the search results, click "clear search" and you will once again be able to see all the images you uploaded.
